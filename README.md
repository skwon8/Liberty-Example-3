# Liberty-Example-3
 Implement a responsive UI based on the designs below. This should follow the designs as close as possible, while fluidly adjusting through a range of viewport sizes from phone to a large desktop view. You do not need to interact with any APIs for data. You should use placeholder text and images where needed.
